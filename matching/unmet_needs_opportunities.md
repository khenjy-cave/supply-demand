# Unmet Needs & Opportunities

Where else could the Omnitags method shine?

## Opportunities:
- **Backend-for-Frontend Systems (BFFs)** that dynamically serve many page types.
- **Mobile App Builders** that need field-driven rendering on-the-fly.
- **Multi-language Schema Syncing** between DB, API, and UI via alias contracts.
- **CLI Tools or DevOps Interfaces** that query many resources via dynamic key maps.

## Tooling Ideas:
- VS Code extension to autocomplete aliases from JSON
- Web-based alias editor with CI/CD sync
- Multi-framework plugin system (e.g., Laravel, Express, Django)

> The next frontier? Letting users define *their own* data contracts.
