# Oversupply Risks

Where could CodeForge be overused?

- Relying too heavily on automation can reduce code literacy.
- Overgeneration of boilerplate may cause long-term maintainability issues.
- Non-tech users might misuse DB design without understanding logic flow.

> Empowerment must be paired with guardrails.
