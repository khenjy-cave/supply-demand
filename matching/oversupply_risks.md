# Oversupply Risks

Possible risks faced include:

- Overbuilding in specific zones of Batam Center without absorbing demand.
- Misalignment between project scale and buyer purchasing power.
- Undifferentiated products in a saturated market.

> Oversupply doesn’t come from building too much—it comes from building without direction.
