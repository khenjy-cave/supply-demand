# Oversupply Risks

Oversupply occurs when the quantity of goods or services exceeds market demand. It leads to price drops, waste, or lost margins.

## Causes:
- Overestimating market size
- Ignoring competitor capacity
- Lack of data-driven forecasting

## Consequences:
- Inventory storage issues
- Discounts that hurt perceived value
- Wasted production resources
