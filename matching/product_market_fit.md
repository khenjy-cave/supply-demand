# Product-Market Fit

How does this repo perfectly serve a niche?

- Fits the solo dev who works across many contexts, tools, and use-cases.
- Enables repeatability in tools that otherwise don’t preserve memory.
- Perfect for systems thinkers who want to avoid brittle setups.

> The fit comes when setup becomes recall—not reinvention.
