# Product-Market Fit

Is the Omnitags method truly needed across platforms?

## Strong Signals of Fit:
✅ Used in dashboards, CMS platforms, no-code builders  
✅ Solves the “why do I need 10 files for CRUD?” problem  
✅ Enables metadata-first API contracts for web/mobile  
✅ Provides a common structure for internal tooling needs

## Obstacles:
❌ Might not satisfy strict code-style teams  
❌ Hard to integrate with statically typed backends (e.g., Go, Rust) without extra tooling  
❌ Will face pushback in highly regulated or test-heavy systems

> Omnitags doesn’t need to win every team—just the right ones.
