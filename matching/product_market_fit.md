# Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit (PMF) is the alignment between what you're offering and what your market *desperately* wants.

## Indicators of PMF:
- Customers come back without reminders
- Word-of-mouth drives growth
- You can’t hire fast enough to keep up with demand

## Testing for PMF:
- Surveys (e.g., “How disappointed would you be if this product went away?”)
- Churn rates and customer retention
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

> “PMF means people want what you built—even if it’s still ugly.”
