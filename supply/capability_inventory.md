# Capability Inventory

What capabilities does the metadata repo include?

- Shortcuts and aliases for GitHub, VS Code, Node.js, Python, Figma, CLI tools, and more.
- One-off processing scripts: conversion tools, metadata extractors, config generators.
- System-wide logic patterns: API wrappers, dev environment sync scripts, helper binaries.

> This repo doesn’t just hold scripts—it holds capability on demand.
