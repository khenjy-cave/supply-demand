# Capability Inventory

The general-purpose Omnitags system can:

- Dynamically resolve database table/field names via aliases
- Enable raw or abstracted SQL queries across entity types
- Provide flexible CRUD scaffolds for multiple domains
- Serve frontend components through alias-based APIs
- Scale horizontally across apps that share logic but differ in structure

> It’s not a backend—it’s a logic orchestrator.
