# Supply Chain

How is the Omnitags method structured in multi-platform environments?

## Core Parts:
- **Alias Map**: Stored as JSON, YAML, DB table, or remote API
- **Resolver Service**: Converts aliases to real DB fields or API properties
- **Base Controller/Service Layer**: Consumes aliases to generate views, APIs, or SQL
- **Dynamic View Generator** (optional): For UI engines (React, Flutter) to consume alias-labeled metadata

## Platform Usage:
- **Web**: Laravel, Express, Django can all use Omnitags-style patterns
- **Mobile**: Flutter or React Native apps use alias-mapped schemas from API responses
- **Desktop**: Electron or Tauri apps can adapt dynamic UI generation via metadata

> The supply chain isn’t physical—it’s config, resolution, and delivery.
