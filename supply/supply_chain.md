# Supply Chain

How does CodeForge work under the hood?

1. Users visually define UI and DB structure.
2. Internal parser converts models to framework-specific code.
3. System packages export as downloadable .zip for deployment.
4. Optional editing before/after export extends flexibility.

> CodeForgeâ€™s chain starts with drag-and-drop and ends in deployable code.
