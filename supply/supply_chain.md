# Supply Chain

The supply chain covers the full journey of a product—from raw material to customer delivery.

## Key Components:
- **Sourcing**: Where and how you get raw materials.
- **Manufacturing**: Assembly or production processes.
- **Logistics**: Warehousing, transportation, fulfillment.
- **Risk Management**: Backup plans, supplier diversification, crisis handling.

> “A chain is only as strong as its weakest vendor.”
