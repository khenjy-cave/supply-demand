# Cost Structure

What are the development and usage costs?

- Maintenance of framework-specific exports (Django, Laravel, Odoo).
- Cost of ensuring security, session management, and cloud compliance.
- Frontend complexity handling with responsive UI.
- Hosting, storage, and bandwidth for generated projects.

> Even tools that save time cost time to maintain.
