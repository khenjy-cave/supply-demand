# Case Studies

## 1. Mobile CMS App
A Flutter-based app uses Omnitags-style aliasing to render form fields dynamically based on metadata from the server—no need to redeploy for schema changes.

## 2. Low-Code SaaS Builder
A startup builds a backend that allows users to define their own "apps" with field names and data types. The Omnitags backend interprets those aliases and handles API routing accordingly.

## 3. Multi-brand Dashboard
An agency serving multiple small businesses builds one dashboard backend with Omnitags. Each brand is mapped via a config file with dynamic field/alias rules.

> Omnitags is not a tool—it’s a pattern that adapts.


# Case Studies

## 1. Multi-brand Product Site Manager
One CMS instance powered three frontends—each with custom fields, languages, and tone—using metadata for field control and layout configuration.

## 2. Internal Knowledge Base
Company used Omnitags CMS to manage onboarding docs, SOPs, and internal guides—no extra code needed to add categories or fields.

## 3. Portfolio Generator
Freelancers used it to dynamically manage case studies and personal project pages without touching backend files.

> A CMS should grow with your content—not against it.
