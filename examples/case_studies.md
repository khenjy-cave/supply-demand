# Case Studies

These real-world examples show how companies responded to demand patterns effectively—or failed to.

## Example 1: Netflix
**Trigger**: Internet bandwidth and streaming habits  
**Response**: Shifted from DVDs to streaming, then to content production.

## Example 2: Kodak
**Trigger**: Rise of digital cameras  
**Response**: Ignored for too long; failed to adapt and lost market share.

## Example 3: Zoom
**Trigger**: COVID-19 pandemic  
**Response**: Scaled rapidly to meet sudden global video conferencing needs.
