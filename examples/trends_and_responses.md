# Trends and Responses

## Rising Trends:
- **Metadata-Driven Everything**: From Google’s API discovery to Notion-style dynamic UIs.
- **Serverless + Dynamic Logic**: Developers use AWS Lambda, Firebase Functions, etc., where static schema wiring is painful.
- **Front-end Schema Awareness**: React, Vue, and mobile frameworks demand context-aware APIs with aliasing.

## How Omnitags Fits:
- Allows clean API contracts even in messy backend schemas.
- Enables schema previews, dynamic joins, and filtering without modifying code for every model.
- Can power admin tools, CMS interfaces, or reporting dashboards across stacks.

> Omnitags is a response to the new dev stack: fast, multi-platform, schema-fluid.
