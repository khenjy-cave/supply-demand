# Value Creation

How does the metadata repository deliver value?

- Centralizes one-off logic that otherwise gets lost in local files or buried in history.
- Increases reusability of helpers and automations.
- Acts as an indexable knowledge base for systems you've learned or customized.

> Value comes from reducing friction and preserving technical memory.
