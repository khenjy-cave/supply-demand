# Value Creation

Value creation is the core of every successful business model. It's about delivering something customers *actually* care about.

## Ways to Create Value:
- **Solving a painful problem**
- **Improving convenience or efficiency**
- **Saving time or money**
- **Offering status, joy, or identity**
- **Building trust or reducing risk**

## Business Perspective:
Value isn't just customer-facing—it also includes **operational efficiency**, **scalability**, and **brand equity**.

> “Real value is when users feel like they'd miss you if you disappeared.”
