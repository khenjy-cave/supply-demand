# Value Creation

Omnitags brings value by centralizing structure and distributing logic dynamically.

## Core Values:
- **Schema Flexibility**: Adapt to new tables and fields with config updates, not code rewrites.
- **Code Simplification**: Shared controllers and services reduce duplication.
- **Frontend Consistency**: APIs return alias-enriched data, helping UIs auto-render dynamic tables or forms.
- **Reduced Time-to-Market**: For startups, internal tools, and MVPs—speed is survival.

> Omnitags turns table chaos into clarity.



# Value Creation

What value does an Omnitags CMS bring?

- Dynamic schema support—define fields in metadata, not code.
- Fewer files, faster deployments—no need to scaffold a new CMS for each app.
- Consistent UX for admins/editors across different content types.
- Easily extendable to support multi-language, SEO fields, or custom logic.

> Value is created when devs spend less time repeating themselves.
