# Target Audience

Who benefits from the Omnitags-style approach?

## Primary Audiences:
- **Solo Developers** building multi-model tools who hate writing the same code 20 times.
- **Low-code/No-code Tool Creators** looking to offer dynamic database access to end users.
- **Backend Engineers** dealing with dynamic form builders, dashboards, or multi-schema platforms.
- **Agencies/Freelancers** who want one flexible backend architecture for many small clients.

## Expansion Audiences:
- **Mobile App Developers** syncing with dynamic backends (e.g., Firebase or Supabase).
- **Internal Tooling Engineers** needing admin panels that scale to many departments with minimal dev overhead.

> If you ever wrote 10 nearly identical CRUDs, Omnitags is probably for you.
