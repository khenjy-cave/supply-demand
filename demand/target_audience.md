# Target Audience

This outlines the groups that expect something from me in each of the 12 life categories.

From college classmates and scholarship boards to family members and teammates in competitions, these are the people and institutions whose expectations shape what I prioritize.

> You may have 12 focuses, but they each have their own crowd.
