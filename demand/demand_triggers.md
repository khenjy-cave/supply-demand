# Demand Triggers

The world is ending... or is it?

Each level begins with a vision of how the world will be destroyedâ€”tidal waves, firestorms, earthquakes, or corruption. These disasters serve as emotional and mechanical triggers for the player's journey.

- Level 1: Cracking Earth (Seismic Destruction)
- Level 2: Dimming Skies (Solar Collapse)
- Level 3: Flooded Fields (Monsoon Rains)
- Level 4: Ember Trees (Forest Fires)
- Level 5: Final Echo (Dimensional Break)
