# Demand Triggers

Why does the need for a metadata repository arise?

- Constant experimentation with tools, APIs, apps, and CLIs creates many one-off scripts.
- Repetitive setup/config needs across projects (e.g., tool aliases, helper functions).
- Increasing complexity in personal dev ecosystems and automation workflows.

> Demand comes from the desire to never rewrite the same code twiceâ€”across any context.
