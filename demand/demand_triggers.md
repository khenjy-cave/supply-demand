# Demand Triggers

Why does CodeForge exist?

- Developers and non-tech users struggle to build full-stack apps quickly.
- Companies want rapid prototyping without deep technical investment.
- Framework-based teams (Django, Laravel, Odoo) need code scaffolding tools.
- Demand for drag-and-drop UI/DB design tools continues to grow.

> CodeForge responds to rising demand for visual app creation and instant code generation.
